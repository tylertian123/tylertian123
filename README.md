### Hi, I'm Tyler
I'm a high school student at Bloor Collegiate Institute interested in robotics, control engineering and software engineering.  
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a2/FIRST_Logo.svg/1200px-FIRST_Logo.svg.png" alt="FIRST Logo" width="25px"> I used to be Programming Lead for [@Arctos6135](https://github.com/Arctos6135/) from 2018-2020 and very involved in FRC in general.
I'm currently trying to learn more about state space and relevant math.

Check out my pins for some of my proudest creations! I've also made minor contributions to open source projects such as [**wpilibsuite/shuffleboard**](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/shuffleboard) and [**naco-siren/vscode-gradle-language**](https://github.com/naco-siren/vscode-gradle-language).
