### Hi, I'm Tyler
First year Engineering student at UofT (EngSci 2T5). Looking for things to do so I don't feel like I'm slacking off.  
Currently trying to finish Multivariable Calculus and Differential Equations on OpenCourseWare.

Check out my pins for some of my proudest creations! I've also made minor contributions to open source projects such as [**wpilibsuite/shuffleboard**](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/shuffleboard) and [**naco-siren/vscode-gradle-language**](https://github.com/naco-siren/vscode-gradle-language).
