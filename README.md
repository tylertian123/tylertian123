### Hi, I'm Tyler
Second year Engineering student at UofT (EngSci 2T5). I like robotics and embedded development.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a2/FIRST_Logo.svg/1200px-FIRST_Logo.svg.png" alt="FIRST Logo" width="25px"> I used to be Programming Lead for [@Arctos6135](https://github.com/Arctos6135/) from 2018-2020 and very involved in FRC in general.

I've also made minor contributions to open source projects such as [**wpilibsuite/shuffleboard**](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/shuffleboard) and [**naco-siren/vscode-gradle-language**](https://github.com/naco-siren/vscode-gradle-language).
